A base project for third person combat. Contains a simple setup for player movement and camera controls with lock on.

# Downloading the Project

**Using Godot 4.2.2**

You must have Blender installed and have Blender imports (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_scenes.html#importing-blend-files-directly-within-godot) configured in your Godot editor. If not, you will get an error saying `Error while loading file 'Main.tcsn'`. Please have a look at https://github.com/Snaiel/Godot4ThirdPersonCombatPrototype/issues/3.
